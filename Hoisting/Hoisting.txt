hositing -allows  to use functions and variables before they're declared.

but if we make the function after the console.log it show the output ,
but ifwe do the same thing in arrow or anonymous function ,throw the error


variable hoisting 

if you declare the variable with var key word after the console.log(),it show the result undiffied

ex:

console.log(a)
var a=1

js cosider:

var a;
console.log(a)
a=1
